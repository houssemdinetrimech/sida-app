          <h3>HIV-1</h3>
          <p>
          HIV-1 was isolated in 1983 by the team of Françoise Barré-Fitoussi and Luc Montagnier, a discovery that earned them the Nobel Prize in Medicine in 2008. It is the most widespread form of the virus around the world.</p>

            The symptoms of Neuroblastoma are variable and dependent on the
            location of the tumor. Most neuroblastomas are found in the abdomen.
            A tumor in the abdomen may cause the child to feel "full", experience
            stomach pain, loss of appetite, constipation and difficulty urinating.
            The child may have "black eyes", much like bruises. Chest tumors may
            cause pain, difficulty breathing, or a persistent cough. Tumors that
            grow in spinal areas may cause the child to have pain, numbness of the
            lower extremities, constipation and difficulty urinating.
          </p>
          <h4>HIV-2</h4>
      
          <p>The HIV-2 form was isolated in 1986. It is less pathogenic than HIV-1: it presents a lower risk of transmission and a slower evolution. HIV-2 is mainly present in West Africa.</p>
